-   **Unit 3: Art of Ancient Egypt**  

    *In this unit, you will learn about the art and culture of Ancient
    Egypt, one of the most powerful civilizations in Western history,
    which emerged around 2700BCE.  Artistic traditions from the Ancient
    Near East informed the arts of Ancient Egypt, though Ancient
    Egyptian art and culture was largely defined by an interest in the
    afterworld.  Magnificently decorated tombs and mortuary complexes
    are a testament to the culture’s belief in an afterlife as well as
    the tremendous wealth of those who commissioned their construction. 
    It is important to note that Ancient Egypt was one of the first
    cultures to have a far-reaching and powerful kingdom; accordingly,
    much of Ancient Egyptian art was designed as propaganda intended to
    assert the power and greatness of the pharaohs.*
