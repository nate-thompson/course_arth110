-   **Unit 2: Art of the Ancient Near East**  

    *In this unit, you will build on what you learned in Unit 1 as we
    examine the settlements and art objects created between around 4000
    BCE and 300 BCE in what we today call the Middle East.  By the start
    of this period, people had abandoned the hunter-gatherer lifestyle
    and were living much more settled lives.  The art from this period
    that has survived was mainly created for religious and political
    purposes.  You will discover that the techniques and materials used
    in the art from this period are more sophisticated than those we
    observed in the previous chapter, suggesting that there was a more
    established niche for art objects at this time.*

    -   Demonstrate an understanding of the general arc of the history
        of the ancient Near East.
    -   Identify the major historical events in the history of the
        ancient Near East and the roles of various religious and
        political leaders in these events.
    -   Demonstrate an understanding of the vital role that imagery
        played as ancient Near Eastern cultures sought to perpetuate
        religious, political, and cultural ideologies.
    -   Explain the relationship between various cultures over time—how
        cultures build on the traditions of older cultures, to create
        something new.
    -   Identify the major stylistic developments in ancient Near
        Eastern art.
    -   Discuss the different techniques used by ancient Near Eastern
        artists and understand why these techniques were favored.

        history changed the appearance, function, and reception of works
        of art.
    -   Identify ancient Near Eastern works of art (and the specific
        culture that produced them) based on an understanding of
        distinctive stylistic features.
    -   Demonstrate an understanding of how ancient Near Eastern
        cultures coexisting in different geographical regions related to
        one another, and how artistic styles were transmitted from one
        region to another.
    -   Identify specific monuments and be able to provide basic
        identifying information, including title, date, location,
        artist, patron, and art-historical period (i.e. Prehistoric,
        Egyptian, Ancient Near East, Gothic, etc).

         Instructions: Click on the link above and follow the directions
        for writing a brief essay (approximately 200 words) that
        compares and contrasts the two works of art depicting
        Mesopotamian Power. You do not need to provide an instructor's
        email; you mail email the essay to yourself or choose to compose
        your writing elsewhere.  
           
         Consider both stylistic elements and historical context as you
        formulate your thoughts.  Ask yourself how each work is
        representative of its culture and use your visual observations
        to make a point about the art of the ancient Near East.  This
        assignment tests your ability to closely examine works of art
        and put your observations to practical use.  The ability to
        compare and contrast works of art is a vital skill in art
        history as subtle differences between works of art often
        highlight major cultural and stylistic differences between art
        historical periods and geographic locations.  Note that this
        exercise asks you to compare two works of art, one of which was
        studied in this unit and one of which was not.  Both are
        representative of the period.  Click the links and read about
        both images to assist you in writing the essay, and use what you
        have learned in this unit to aid your observations.  Use the
        Saylor Foundation’s “[Guide to Responding to Assignment
        1](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ARTH110-Guide-for-Responding-11.pdf)”
