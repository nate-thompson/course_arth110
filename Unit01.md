-   **Unit 1: Art Before History**  

    *This course begins with the very first art created by humans in the
    Prehistoric era.  As the name suggests, what we term “the
    Prehistoric period” encompasses the time before recorded human
    history, when humans had not yet developed a written language. 
    Therefore, Prehistoric art presents something of a challenge to
    scholars seeking to understand the motivations of people living at
    this time.  Nonetheless, art historians have been able to develop an
    understanding of the possible functions and meanings of Prehistoric
    art.  This unit will teach you the major stylistic features and
    historical issues of art from this period, which serves as a
    foundation for the arts created later in the West.*

    to:

    -   Demonstrate an understanding of the general arc of the history
        of the Prehistoric Period.

        cultures build on the traditions of older cultures, to create
        something new.
    -   Identify the major stylistic developments in Prehistoric art.
    -   Discuss the different techniques and materials used by

        materials were favored.

        over the course of history changed the appearance, function, and
        reception of works of art.
    -   Identify Prehistoric works of art based on an understanding of
        distinctive stylistic features.
    -   Demonstrate an understanding of how Prehistoric cultures in
        different geographical regions related to one another and how

    -   Identify specific monuments and be able to provide basic
        identifying information, including title, date, location,
        artist, patron, and art-historical period (i.e. Prehistoric,
        Egyptian, Ancient Near East, Gothic, etc).
