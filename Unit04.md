-   **Unit 4: Ancient Art of the Classical World**  

    *In this unit, you will learn about the classical world in the areas
    around the Aegean and Mediterranean seas.  Much like the Ancient
    Egyptians, these cultures had far-reaching power, and the art and
    architecture they produced speaks of this power.  It is in these
    cultures that the idea of Western civilization, as we understand it
    today, is rooted.  For example, the Ancient Greeks were among the
    first people to establish a democratic society, which served as
    inspiration for later democratic civilizations, including the United
    States.  Religion was also very important in the classical world,
    and there are abundant remains of temples and religious objects that
    give us a sense of the significance of religion in these societies. 
    The artistic traditions from these different cultures were shaped by
    one another, and had a tremendous effect on later arts created in
    the West.*
