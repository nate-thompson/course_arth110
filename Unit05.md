-   **Unit 5: Medieval Art**  

    *In the final unit of this course, you will look at the art of the
    Medieval period.  There is a common misconception that Medieval
    culture was entirely at odds with the traditions of the classical
    world.  In this unit, you will learn that Medieval art in fact grew
    out of these traditions, reshaping them according to the new demands
    of a post-classical world.  With the fall of the Roman Empire, a new
    Empire centered in Constantinople, capitol of the Byzantine world,
    began to develop.  In northern Europe, “Barbarian” and Viking art
    was able to flourish and supplant the cultural authority of the
    Romans.  Christianity came to replace the Roman Empire as the great
    unifier of the Western world.  As a result, nearly all of the art
    created in this period had a Christian function.*  
       
     *In the East, Islam was the predominant unifier, and western
    Christianity’s relationship with Islam played a large part in the
    development of Medieval European culture.  We will accordingly take
    a brief look at Islamic art before concluding the course with an
    introduction to the High Gothic period, which represented a
    culmination of the ideas of Medieval Europe.*
