Course Syllabus for "ARTH110: Introduction to Western Art History: Pre-historic to High Gothic"
--------------------------------------------------------------

In this course, we will study the history of Western art, beginning with
the first objects created by prehistoric humans around 20,000 years ago
and ending with the art and architecture of the High Gothic period in
fourteenth-century Europe.  The information presented in this course
will provide you with the tools to recognize important works of art and
historical styles, as well as to understand the historical context and
cultural developments of Western art history through the end of the
medieval period.  Introductory readings paired with detailed lectures
will provide you with a well-rounded sense of the history, art, and
culture of the West up through the medieval period. At the end of this
course, you will be able to identify key works of art and artistic
periods in Western history.  You will also be able to discuss the
development of stylistic movements and relate those developments to
important historical events.  Completion of this course will prepare you
for ARTH111, which surveys the history of Western art beginning with the
early Renaissance. (Note: This course will make use of a series of
lectures from Professor Heather C. McCune Bruhn at Pennsylvania State
University.  You may notice that the Professor frequently refers to a
class textbook; please disregard these references, as we will be using a
packet of various web-based materials instead.)
